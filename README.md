Airplane Incident Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset on airplane incidents, focusing on the involvement of specific aircraft types in incidents and the relationship between aircraft registration and crash occurrences. By exploring these aspects, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that can help improve aviation safety and incident management.

Analysis Highlights
Aircraft Type Involvement in Incidents:

The analysis groups data by aircraft type (AC Type) to identify how frequently each type has been involved in incidents. This approach helps in pinpointing specific aircraft models that may require closer inspection or enhanced safety protocols.
Registration and Crash Occurrences:

This section of the analysis examines the relationship between aircraft registrations and the frequency of crashes. By grouping incidents based on the unique registration identifiers of aircraft, the analysis reveals patterns in crash occurrences, which could indicate issues with certain aircraft or registration-related factors affecting crash rates.
Results
The output includes a summary of incident counts for each aircraft type and a report on the frequency of crashes by registration. These findings provide valuable insights into aircraft safety and operational patterns, assisting stakeholders in targeting areas for safety improvements.
